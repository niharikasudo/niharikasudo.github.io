artist.<br>

                <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
                <p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">I looked into the market to identify unserved opportunities and develop a marketing strategy. I have
taken 2 competitors, Tattoodo app (direct competitor) and Pinterest app (indirect competitor).</span> From
online research, I learnt that many users use Pinterest to find ideas for their tattoos.
Pinterest is popularly known for finding and saving ideas from around the world and tattoo is one of
their category.</p>

			   <h4>HIDE DETAILED ANALYSIS</h4>
			   
			   
			   
			   <p>
			   I found that -<br><br>
1. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">Tattoodo apps lack personalization.</span> I can use AI (Artificial intelligence) to provide personalized
search result. To show images similar to their likings (using there clicks and likes).<br><br>
2. Human-centric designs is the key to long-lasting client relationships. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">If we look into Marketing profile
of Tattoodo app it's mostly concentrating towards promoting tattoo artists and getting bookings. I
would focus on providing usability and utility for the users, making it easier for them to benefit from
the app, and then direct them towards the booking.</span><br><br>
3. Pinterest is popular and amazing, <span class="highlight highlight-REI">but it's not a tattoo oriented app so we have an advantage here.</span><br><br>
4. UI on Pinterest is not gender-neutral. 70% of Pinterest users are females.

				<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">I used survey to understand who our users are (demographics) and get more reliable information.</span></p>
				<p>1. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">Uncover what users want from a 'tattoo app'. (Interview questions 3,5 & 7)</span></p>

				<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">I conducted this survey on SurveyMonkey.</span><br>
I shared it among my friends on WhatsApp. I was happy to get 14 participants with tattoos.
They are from different locations like Sweden, Germany, the UK, Bahrain and India. In future, I would
aim to get wider range of participants</p>

attention to following four findings.</span></p>
                <p>1. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">Behaviors and attitudes that would inform answers to the research goals.</span><br>
2. Picked out <span class="highlight highlight-REI">Needs and goals</span> the participants mentioned.<br>

				<p align="center"><img src="images/mapping.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
				
				
				<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">Clustering similar notes that share a particular theme and gather insights from it.</span> Conducted a few
rounds of affinity mapping to get a good set of perspectives from the data.</p>

<p>I decided to skip personas for this project and jump directly to user flow. Personas are great to add
life/human element to the list of insights extracted from affinity mapping. But I feel that the raw data
gets diluted when adding a lot of assumptions. I can make a better design decision based on real data
from real users. Also, I can easily empathize with the data as they are from real users.

                <h4>Usability test</h4>
                <p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">I conducted usability tests to evaluate what people said and their action when interacting with the
product.</span> Observed where participants got confused or made wrong choices, took notes, and then
implemented steps to correct the issues.</p>
<p>I conducted Moderated in-person tests. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">Users were given a specific set of tasks to complete, and the
efficiency and ease with which they completed them were recorded</span></p>

			
			<p><strong>Link to Usability Test Script</strong></p>
			
			<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">Similar to affinity mapping I did earlier, I combed through the audio recording and notes to extract
information into the following categories, Observations, Positive Quotes, Negative Quotes, and Errors.</span>
Each participant is labelled from P1, P2 and P6. <span class="highlight highlight-REI">I ended up with 20-25 core observations that I
followed up on using 'Rainbow Spreadsheet'. I am using Rainbow spreadsheet to stack these
observations based on severity and priority</span> and hypothetically it's easier to present it to the
stakeholders .</p>

<p id="rainbow"><strong>The Rainbow Spreadsheet</strong></p>


<p>This Spreadsheet is setup by assigning each participant with color and adding it to the columns. Rows
are entered with observations from the affinity map. On the intersection, <span class="highlight highlight-REI">I input 'severity of errors'
ranking them according to Jakob Nielsen's four-step rating scale from 0 to 4.</span></p>
<p>One framework for examining usability is Jakob Nielsen's Five Components on Usability, which covers
learnability, efficiency, memorability, satisfaction, and errors.
<span class="highlight highlight-REI">I mainly focused on errors to measure 'task success' as it is one of our design metrics.
Secondly, to measure satisfaction, I followed up with a survey to obtain user satisfaction score.</span></p>

on the negative feedback to produce solutions aligning to the goal of the project.</span></p>

				 <p>This aligns with our goal, by providing a detailed review, we make it easier for the user to judge/trust
an artist. This, in turn, increases the chances of the user booking an appointment</p>

<p><strong>Below are the few changes I made to fix remaining errors and improve the usability and utility of
the app</strong></p>


<p><strong>Onboarding</strong></p>

<p>I replaced 3 onboarding page that explains what our product does to 1 onboarding page to learn
about our user. I'll guide them with instructions as and when they are using the app. Instead I used
this page to add personalization and learn about their interests to provide personalized feed.</p>
<p>User intent boarding (Learnt from growth the design) "If we want a successful user. we need to
understand why the user came for. Generic goals won't cut it."</p>

<p><strong>Call to action (CTA)</strong></p>

<p>Since the end goal of the app is for the user to book an appointment with a tattoo artist through the
app. On the artists' page, I replace the 'message' icon with "Book an appointment" to have a clear CTA.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>

<p>Wordings (Tile below the image) added to explain the context of the image. Previously I had options
(like and share) to appear on the image upon hovering on it. Now, these options are static.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="images/solutions-6.png" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p>Similarly, I went through all the functionalities/user flow of the application to make sure I follow A, AA, or AAA
compliance mentioned in WCAG guidelines. I checked the color contrast ratio of the app on an accessibility
test website.</p>

feedback on my work and also asked them to complete a survey at the end of it. That will help me
learn their overall experience using the prototype of the app.</p>
<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">I conducted this survey with 6 participants. Each rating how easy was it for them to complete the task
using the product, overall experience using the product and how likely are they to recommend it to
their friends and family.</span>

<p align="center"><img src="images/SURVEY-GRAPH.png" class="img-responsive"></p>

<p><span class="highlight highlight-REI">It was clear to say that it was easy for them to complete the task, and the over all experience is 50%
which is still a positive response.</span></p>

appointment' on an app, with a tattoo artist. As that was the goal of the project and the application. My
future steps would be to design the steps for the user after they book an appointment, on the app.</span><br>
One example is adding the appointment to their calendar, and reminding them of the appointment.
Asking the user's experience (review) after their appointment.

					<p>Don't resize icons or images making them stretched or skewed this distorts them
creating uneven dimensions.</p>
<p>Use recurring elements, don't create new ones if unnecessary, follow patterns to
insure consistent design.</p>

					<p>language is easy to understand and follow along.</p>
