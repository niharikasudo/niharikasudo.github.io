                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>We started this as a collaboration project for UX Design Contest by Adam Ruf.
I brought in the idea of redesigning the COSTCO platform as I am a regular and loyal Costco customer.
However, this UX Redesign Contest made me wonder why my husband and I always preferred
purchasing in-store rather than shop online at Costco's website. It was then we picked this website for
our redesigning venture.</p>
              </div>
			  
			  
			  
			  <h4>Result of The UX Design Contest</h4>
                <p>Our work gets recognized as the winning entry for UX Design Contest.<br>
Valuable charity was made to Make-A-Wish Foundation with our winning prize. :)</p>

 <div id="my-contribution" class="subgroup">
                <h4>My Contribution</h4>
               <p>We are a team of 2 self-taught UX Designers.<br>
On deciding on the design process, we planned and divided the tasks among us. I took responsibility
for research and brainstorming activities. I conducted and documented the interviews. Over a skype
call, we used affinity mapping to drew insights from the data. We listed and highlighted the problems to
derive solutions.<br>
From the interview insights, I assembled customer journey mapping to explore opportunities.<br>
We came up with 3 design challenges. I did first challenge, we shared the second one and I contributed
to the third one.
</p>


                <h4>The Role Players</h4>
               <p>Since we were geographically based out of different locations, we used collaborative tools like Click up
and JIRA to plan and collaborate on this project . Below are mentioned are few other tools and
methods we used to plan, stay organized and stick to the schedule.

              <div id="competitive-analysis" class="subgroup">
                <p>Before kicking off the design process, we wanted to understand what the company does and how does
it roles out its business in the market. Here is a quick snap of what we found out.<br>
<br>

Costco is an <strong>online membership-based warehouse</strong>. It is a selling point for household, electronic, and
cosmetic products. It's headquarter is placed in Issaquah, Washington and has a revenue of <strong style="color:#FF3300">$154,7B</strong>
and over <strong style="color:#000099">2,54,000 employees</strong>. Its main competitors are <strong>Amazon, Walmart, and Target.</strong></p>

 <p align="center"><img src="images/business-study01.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
 
 <p><strong>What does it aims at ( Business Strategy )?</strong></p>
 
 
 <p>Costco's business model is to <strong>generate high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover</strong> by
offering <strong  style="color:#000099">members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected privatelabel products in a wide range of merchandise.</strong></p>

<p>Every customers want to find good quality bargains and Costco is a setup to keep their customers
coming back to find them. Costco builds its business model on principle strategy of low prices, limited
selection, and a treasure-hunt shopping environment.</p>

<p><strong>How does COSTCO works ( The ROI Factor )?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how COSTCO gets it return of investment from the business model.</p>

                <p>The approach that we decided to use for this challenge was of Ideo’s human-centered design and Lean
UX design thinking process. The design decisions were supported by user research and feedback</p>

				<p>1. Identify critical demographics of the potential users of the COSTCO web application to help us build
the user persona.</p>
<p>2. Identify the level of interest, frequency of usage and goals of those users interacting with the
application.</p>
<p>3. Identify user pain points with existing COSTCO platform. Collect data on the scenario in which users
would use an eCommerce platform for shopping</p>

				<p><strong>Business Problem</strong> — Costco is known for its enjoyable in-store shopping experience at reduced
prices and outstanding business model. However, most customers prefer spending time in offline
shopping rather than online. Hence the website is failing to provide its value to the customer
experience.</p>

<p><strong>User Perspective</strong> — One such problem is the ability to search for products efficiently on the platform.
The user fails to understand important product details such as price differences which makes
information exceptionally non-transparent. Additional to that, the clustered outlook and poor</p>


<h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">S</span>olution Statement</h4>
				
				<p>Costco customers usually love to buy product “on-sales” as the human brain gets artificially influenced,
comparing the original price “slashed down” to a lower amount. They expect a relevant and
personalized experience from the platform, as they do in-store. A well-defined search and navigation
experience attracts and retains customers. Also, highlighting the important information of products
very transparently to the users promises a boost on increasing the online sales and conversions.</p>

our thoughts in a more structured manner.</p>

As a user, I want to search for a product quickly across the available department categories on the
Costco platform. </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>User Requirements</strong></p>

customers go through while searching for a product. It will help us understand the gaps in customer
experience and explore new opportunities. we used insights from user research and analytics from the
survey to base our assumption in this customer journey mapping.</p>

<p>4. Different Views for a Product ( Washing

				<p>1. Every CTA opens up to a new branch here. </p>
<p>2. Refined Navigation Heirarchy ( TIER 1 CTAs -
Search, ZIP Code, SideBar Navigation; TIER 2
CTAs - COSTCO Servieces) </p>
<p>3. Minimum Number of Navigation Branches - 3 </p>
<p>4. Single for a Product ( Washing Machine - if
the user goes through the landing serach
page or categories page or offers page, he
will always land on the same washing
machine list page with refined filters on the
basis of chosen parameters by the user. )

              <h2>Prototype</h2>
			  <p>The information architecture that was analyzed through user flows and customer journey mapping was
then being transformed into own wireframes. We dig deeper to find out what was wrong in each
screen from the usability and design prospect</p>
              <div id="design1" class="subgroup">
                <h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">D</span>esign Challenge One</h4>
                <p><strong>The challenge :</strong> User onboarding on the Costco website ( Costco homepage), since it is the starting
step for the user to use any functionality on the platform. Hence, we focused on improvising the
dashboard experience first.</p>

<p><strong>Design problem artefacts and highlights :</strong> the below image talks about the problem we noticed on
the current screen, and why?</p>

				<h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">T</span>hings We Improvised </h4>
				
				<p><strong>1. Primary and Secondary Data</strong><br>
We removed the necessary secondary actions from the website.<br>
The other categories ( COSTCO services ) were shifted to the side navigation menu so that the user can
focus more on the primary information such as SEAR, login, REGISTER, and other.</p>

<p><strong>2. Data Categorization</strong><br>
We decluttered different sections of the website to help users categorize the information based on
their requirements. We highlighted each section differently so that the user can view them separately
and navigate accordingly from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>3. Design Hygiene</strong><br>
We introduced design hygiene in the system, and we brought in the uniformity in text, icons, and other
font formats with appropriate white spacing. It decreased the heaviness of the system in totality. It also
ensured to create a first good impression on any user who will be visiting the website for the very first
time.</p>
				
              </div>
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  
			  <div id="design2" class="subgroup">
                <h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">D</span>esign Challenge Two </h4>
                <p><strong>The challenge :</strong> user search and navigation experience on the COSTCO website since the user needs
to move freely across the site and provide them with proper feedback during the searching of the
product</p>

<p><strong>Search Feature Difficulties :</strong> The below image talks about the problem we noticed on the current
screen, and why?</p>
				
				
				<p align="center"><img src="images/2--a.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
				
				<p align="center"><img src="images/2--b.jpg" class="img-responsive"></p>
				
				
				
				<h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">T</span>hings We Improvised </h4>
				
				<p><strong>1. Search with Autocomplete Design</strong><br>
We reworked on the autocomplete feature of the search showing them more relevant search results.
As represented in the first image, the search results highlight the differences in the search</p>

<p><strong>2. Search with No Result</strong><br>
The No Result feature is added to the search bar. We initiate the user to go ahead and try with a
different text input to search on the screen. The design does not discourage the user from getting out
of the system, in case he has found his desired result.</p>

<p><strong>3. Search with Search Result Grouping</strong><br>
It is essential to capture results from different entities, which makes the suggestions potential enough
for the user creating a better and easier navigation experience for the user.
</p>


<p><strong>4. Search with Back Navigation and Autofocus</strong><br>
On the click search icon, the search box takes the entire focus on the screen so that the user can focus
only on his search constraints. It also has back navigation across the search box; the user can
immediately back navigate to the previous view.
</p>


<p><strong>5. Product Categorization</strong><br>
We have created subcategories and parent category ( try to stay under 10 per class not to overwhelm
the user. ). The "Categories" are mutually exclusive of the "filters." Filtered product attributes ( or
product states ) should not be confused with categories.
</p>


<p><strong>6. Set Reminders</strong><br>
The searched out products in the results which are not available currently or is out of stock, users can
actually set up reminder to receive notification , once the particular product is back in the market.

                <h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">D</span>esign Challenge Three </h4>
                <p><strong>The challenge :</strong> user product page and filter, since it is important for the user to easily categorize
among the different groups of the product. The filter needs to be narrowed down to a single search so
the user can avail of his desired product within the shortest amount of time.</p>

				<h4><span style="background-color:#CCCCCC">T</span>hings We Improvised </h4>
				
				<p><strong>1. Product with Pricing Difference and Savings</strong><br>
We introduced the pricing highlight along with “strike -off” original pricing that will encourage user to
buy the product, as they can easily understand price difference after discount.</p>

<p><strong>2. Product Filters </strong><br>
We introduced faceted filters to help narrow down the product choices and also provided relevant
sorting and filtering option to the entire list. Each products are listed in appropriate category and have
relevant filters that will only search thought the selected categories.
</p>

<p><strong>3. Easy Add to Cart </strong><br>
We also provided the easy add to cart functionality directly on the list page by introducing the cart
option, user can directly add the quantity and click on the cart icon. After the product is added to the
cart, we highlight the card with a double tick and also update the cart at the top right corner with the
count.

              <h2>Usability Test</h2>
			  <p>After creating the prototypes, we then went ahead with usability testing to understand if the designs are
really solving people’s problems. we did this with the help of a platform called usability hub.
We did base our usability test on three testing matrix .</p>

		  <section id="reiterate" class="fh5co-heading-pro">
              <h2>Reiterate</h2>
			  <p>we checked the usability tests and found that the first two tests did really well, However, people were
not much happy with product card designs as they found the image really small. Hence we went ahead
and recreated the designs to get it validated</p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
			  <p>future product scopes</p>
<p>1. the end checkout experience needs to be worked upon.</p>
<p>2. users should get emails and notifications from the COSTCO office, or they should have an online
costco support system.</p>
              
			  
			 <p><strong>Lessons learnt</strong></p>
			 
			 <p>We only did three tests due to the pricing limit of our testing platform, hence we could not show the
relevant comparisons between old and new designs.</p>

<p>We compromised on the size of the product images on the product’s category page, despite doing
good design, it compromised with the user’s readability and product scanning. Due to this, they went
ahead with the old design. However, we took that into our redesigning aspect</p>

<p><strong>End story</strong></p>
<p>For this case study, we understood the importance of user experience on an e-Commerce platform.
online sales can boom the business of these companies in a magical way if we provide users with
similar offline experiences. An eased out usability increases the scope of the same.</p>
